# Analysis of Global Layoffs During and After COVID-19

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing layoffs across various countries, companies, and industries starting from 2020. The dataset includes details about the total number of employees laid off, industries affected, and dates of layoffs. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights into which industries and companies were hit the hardest, using MySQL for data querying and analysis.

- In 2021, **Bytedance** ranked first with 3,600 employees laid off.
- **Meta** had a significant number of layoffs in 2022, ranking second with 11,000 laid off employees.

### Layoffs by Industries

### Yearly Layoff Trends
2022 witnessed the highest number of layoffs across all industries, with a remarkable total of 160,661 employees being laid off. Given that the data for 2023 only includes the first three months, during which layoffs already totaled 125,677, it's anticipated that the total for 2023 may surpass the record set in 2022.
